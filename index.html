        <p>
          I'm an <strong>INQUISITIVE, FOCUSED, COMMITED and INNOVATIVE</strong> person.
          I seek and acquire knowledge from tech enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in the front-end engineering track at Altschool with the student ID <strong>
            ALT/SOE/8272 </strong>. My
          current goal within Altschool is to make the institution proud and spread the message of Altschool worldwide.
          I
          have several diverse reasons for joining Altschool.
        </p>

        <p>
          I envision a promising future for Altschool. I can't help but see Altschool as the next Andela. I firmly
          believe
          that Altschool is on a path to great success, so why would I want to miss this opportunity? I am committed to
          doing my best to cover the fees and benefit from the expertise of tech professionals. My aspiration is to gain
          valuable knowledge from Altschool Africa and become a top-notch front-end engineer. With the help of God and
          consistency, I
          hope to achieve this.
